/*
* This header is for registering features to display stuff with Dear ImGui. Some
* features are nice to have a GUI for, some might only be nice to use through
* the console, and some could be a hybrid mix of both. Usually, I think it would
* be ideal for most features to be entirely usable through the console, and
* optionally have a GUI for *most* of its functionality. This is to allow users
* to set up binds for their favorite features! If a feature has some parts of it
* available through the console AND the GUI, please let the user know somehow
* (e.g. if you can change the value of a cvar with a checkbox or a text field in
* ImGui, show the specific cvar that is being set in the GUI with at least a
* tooltip or something).
* 
* To register a feature to draw something with Dear ImGui, use one of the 'register'
* functions below. To simplify the look of the GUI, I think that most of the
* functionality of SPT's features should fit within a single main window. I've tried
* to roughly organize SPT's features into categories and subcategories corresponding
* to tabs and subtabs in what I'm calling the "main" window. UI design is one of my
* "top 10 things I probably don't want to do for a living", so there might be a
* better way of organizing everything. This approach is pretty simple and scalable.
* 
* Each feature can:
* - live in a single tab/subtab in the main window
* - live in a single section within a tab
* - live in a separate window
* - a combination of the above - features are allowed to live across several
*   tabs in the main window, but that requires the use of several callbacks
* 
* Some important things to keep in mind:
* 
* - Don't reinterpret cast from color32 to ImU32! Use the conversion functions
*   below or better yet, use ImVec4 directly.
* 
* - Please save yourself some trouble and read about the ImGui stack system:
*   https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#q-about-the-id-stack-system
*   Go to DEV -> "Show ImGui example window", then Tools -> ID Stack Tool. This
*   is extremely helpful for determining why widgets don't react to input
*   events sometimes. All tabs/sections have their own ID scope.
*
* - Read about other debug tools: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Debug-Tools.
* 
* - The ImGui example window is your best friend for learning how to write your
*   own ImGui code. See: SPT -> DEV -> "Show ImGui example window". Look
*   through it to see if the thing you're trying to do is already in there,
*   then look for the code in imgui_demo.cpp.
* 
* - For displaying ConVars, I think a good approach is to let any value set
*   through the console take priority over any value set through the GUI.
*   Widgets like e.g. DragFloat() work nicely with this because they won't
*   override the value that you passed in unless the user starts dragging the
*   widget. For example if you want a listbox with 4 choices from a cvar, a
*   good approach would be to use var.GetInt() and clamp the value to [0, 3],
*   then only update the cvar if the user selects something in the widget.
* 
* - Don't rely on the imgui callbacks to update feature internals if you want
*   to check for something regularly, use e.g. SV_FrameSignal. The ImGui
*   callbacks are not guaranteed to be called every frame.
* 
* - With the current implementation of input events, ImGui will not see key &
*   mouse events when there is no game UI open.

/*
* This describes all tabs/sections in the main ImGui window. This approach of listing
* all the tabs in one place may seem a bit weird at first, but it makes it pretty
* easy to see the general UI layout at a glance (unlike spt_hud's approach of using a
* sort key). If you want to add your own section/tab, add it below! Do not make your
* own instances of the Section/Tab objects - the constructors here rely on static
* initialization order to determine the order of the tabs/subtabs/sections. The root
* tab should be first, and the dummy tab should be last. Try to order everything by
* most commonly used features first.
* 
* If a section/tab does not have a user defined callback, it will not be rendered!
* This applies recursively (if a tab has many child tabs/sections, and none of those
* children have callbacks, the parent tab won't be rendered). This is to prevent a
* bunch of empty sections/tabs from showing up when features fail to load. It also
* makes it really easy to see at a glance which features are supported in the current
* SPT/game version. In some cases, it can be easier to disable a section of the GUI
* instead of preventing it from being drawn if e.g. a cvar isn't initialized. See the
* BeginCmdGroup()/EndCmdGroup() functions below.
* 
* On the contrary, if you've registered a callback, it will always be rendered even
* if you don't draw anything. This means you should always draw something! If your
* feature is disabled because of game/version incompatibilities, don't register the
* callback. If your feature is disabled because of some other runtime condition
* (e.g. player has no portal gun or server is not active), draw the full UI of the
* feature within an ImGui::BeginDisabled block (and preferably let the user know why
* the feature is disabled in the UI).
* 
* Tab::RegisterUserCallback() & Section::RegisterUserCallback() return true if the
* internal feature is loaded. If the return value is false, the callback will *not*
* be called. If you want to display a separate window for your feature, use
* RegisterWindowCallback().
* 
* Each leaf section/tab should have at most a single callback. Section/tab
* callbacks are allowed to make their own windows, but keep in mind that those
* windows won't show when the tab is closed. It's recommended to register a
* separate window callback for separate windows.
