SourcePauseTool
===============

A plugin for all your pausing needs.

## Usage
Place the compiled `spt.dll` into your mod directory (for example: `hl2`, `portal`, `ep2`), launch the game and type `plugin_load spt` into the developer console. For older engines you will need to place `spt.dll` into the topmost `bin` directory (the one with a lot of different DLL files including `engine.dll`, *not* the one with `client.dll` and `server.dll`).

## Building
You will need Visual Studio 2017 or above.
1. Get and build Detours v3.0 Express. This one is pretty annoying because it requires Visual Studio 2010. Copy the files from the resulting `include` and `lib.X86` folders into the respective folders in the `Detours` directory.
2. Get the Source SDK code that you wish to build SPT for.
3. Clone this repository into a folder under `src\utils`, where `src` is the folder with the Source SDK source code. The files from this repository should end up inside `src\utils\SourcePauseTool`.
4. Inside the `SourcePauseTool` folder do `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
5. Open `spt.sln` in Visual Studio and build the correct build configuration:
   - Release OE for Source SDK 2006
   - Release for Source SDK 2007
   - Release 2013 for Source SDK 2013
   - Release P2 for the Portal 2 SDK from alliedmodders.
