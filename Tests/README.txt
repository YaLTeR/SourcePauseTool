How to run tests:

Install Python (any Python 3 will probably work) and put it in your PATH env variable.
Set up your config.ini to include all the build directories you have (see format in config_example.ini).
Run the tests with the command from this folder: python run_tests.py > output.txt. The games will be automatically started.
Open output.txt to see output.
